# WurmTreeGrowthMod
A small mod for Wurm Unlimited that allows modification of tree growth speed.

It requires Ago's modloader to work. It can be found here: https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher

To use it, simply place the extracted files in the mods folder of your WurmServerLauncher directory.

Mod settings can be changed in the file wurmtreegrowthmod.properties.

Currently, it allows modification of the chance that a tree will age one stage and the chance that a shriveled tree will die when the tile is polled. It is recommended to try to keep these two values balanced in order to avoid getting forests with unbalanced tree ages, i.e only old trees.
